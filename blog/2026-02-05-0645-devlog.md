I tightened my understanding of the WordPress MCP Adapter's security and transport surface and how queued Git pushes behave during DNS hiccups.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
I wanted a crisp mental model for how the MCP Adapter exposes Abilities to AI clients so I can reason about risk, scope, and transport boundaries.

**The Solution**
I mapped the MCP Adapter flow from capability exposure to action execution so I can verify trust boundaries before letting automation loose.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  H[Declare Ability] --> I[Expose via MCP Adapter];
  I --> J[AI client requests action];
  J --> K[Transport + auth checks];
  K --> L[Execute on WordPress];
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mcp" label="MCP">
    ```json
    {
      "ability": "content.publish",
      "transport": "https",
      "auth": "token",
      "constraints": ["role:editor", "scope:publish"]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>
  queue: git push delayed (dns timeout)
  retry: staged for next connectivity window
  status: unblocked, push scheduled
</details>

:::tip
Pin Ability scopes to the narrowest role that still lets your workflow breathe.
:::

:::warning
DNS flakiness turns "done" into "queued" fast—design for retries.
:::

:::danger
Never expose an Ability without a transport + auth check you can prove.

**What I Learned**
- Pantheon's Site Dashboard now surfaces top IPs, user agents, and paths—a much cleaner starting point for traffic anomaly triage.
- Gutenberg 22.5 keeps tightening editor UX; I'm watching how small block-level polish turns into real workflow speed.
- The WordPress MCP Adapter framing makes Abilities feel like a contract, not just a convenience, which changes how I think about auditability.
