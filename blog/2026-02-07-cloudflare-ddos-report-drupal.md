The Cloudflare 2025 Q4 DDoS threat report has just been released, and the numbers are staggering. A record-breaking **31.4 Tbps attack** was mitigated in November 2025, and hyper-volumetric attacks have grown by **700%**. 

For Drupal site owners, these aren't just statistics—they represent a fundamental shift in the scale of threats our infrastructure must withstand.

## The Aisuru-Kimwolf Botnet Threat
The report highlights the rise of the **Aisuru-Kimwolf botnet**, which leverages Android TVs to launch HTTP DDoS attacks exceeding **200 million requests per second (RPS)**. When an attack of this magnitude hits a CMS like Drupal, even the most optimized database queries can become a bottleneck if the attack bypasses the edge cache.

## Key Findings for Infrastructure
- **Short, Intense Bursts:** Many record attacks lasted less than a minute but were intense enough to knock unprotected systems offline instantly.
- **Cache-Busting Tactics:** Attackers are increasingly using sophisticated patterns to bypass CDN caching, forcing the application server to process every request.
- **Industry Targeting:** Telecommunications and service providers are top targets, but any high-profile site is at risk.

## Introducing: Drupal DDoS Resilience Toolkit
To help Drupal communities implement defense-in-depth, I've built the **DDoS Resilience Toolkit**. This module provides application-level safeguards that complement edge protection like Cloudflare.

[View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-ddos-resilience-toolkit)

### Features:
1. **Cloudflare Integrity Enforcement:** Ensuring your origin ONLY talks to Cloudflare, preventing attackers from bypassing your WAF by hitting your IP directly.
2. **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** A lightweight, cache-backed mechanism to throttle suspicious IP addresses before they exhaust PHP workers.
3. **Pattern-Based Blocking:** Detecting "cache-buster" query strings that deviate from normal site usage.

## Conclusion
As we move into 2026, the scale of DDoS attacks will only increase. Relying solely on default configurations is no longer enough. By combining edge mitigation with application-level resilience, we can ensure our Drupal sites remain performant even under extreme pressure.
