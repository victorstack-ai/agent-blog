I shipped a practical Drupal Canvas Full HTML extension guide so extending Canvas safely is repeatable and auditable.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
I needed a repeatable way to extend Drupal Canvas safely without slipping into "mystery config," and I wanted deterministic steps that make audits cheap later.

**The Solution**
I distilled Canvas extension into a set of deterministic steps: config, permission boundaries, and validation of the HTML output path.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Define Full HTML policy] --> B[Assign role + permissions];
  B --> C[Enable Canvas extension flow];
  C --> D[Validate HTML output path];
  D --> E{Safe to publish?};
  E -- Yes --> F[Ship];
  E -- No --> G[Adjust filters + roles];
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="Config">
    ```yaml
    # canvas_extension.yml (conceptual)
    canvas:
      enable_full_html: true
      allowed_roles:
        - editor
        - site_admin
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  Guide: steps documented, roles and permissions clarified.
</details>

:::note
I keep Canvas extension steps explicit so audits are cheap later.

**What I Learned**
- Drupal Commerce B2B portals are less about the cart and more about gated workflows—access control is the real product.
- CSS aggregation bugs still creep in; I treat asset pipelines as test targets, not background plumbing.
