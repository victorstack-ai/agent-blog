Recently, [Simon Willison shared research](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/6/pydantic-monty/) on running Pydantic's **Monty** in WebAssembly. Monty is a minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust, designed specifically for safely executing code generated by LLMs.

The key breakthrough here is the ability to run Python code with **microsecond latency** in a strictly sandboxed environment, either on the server (via Rust/Python) or directly in the browser (via WASM).

I've put together a demo project that explores both the Python integration and the WebAssembly build.

### What is Monty?

Monty is a subset of Python implemented in Rust. Unlike Pyodide or MicroPython, which aim for full or broad compatibility, Monty is built for speed and security. It provides:

1. **Restricted Environment**: No access to the host file system or network by default.
2. **Fast Startup**: Ideal for "serverless" or "agentic" workflows where you need to run small snippets of code frequently.
3. **Rust Foundation**: Leveraging Rust's safety and performance.

### Running it in the Browser

By compiling Monty to WebAssembly, we can provide a Python REPL that runs entirely on the client side. This is perfect for interactive documentation, playground environments, or edge-side code execution.

In my demo, I've included the WASM assets and a simple HTML interface to try it out.

### Why this matters for AI Agents

AI agents often need to execute code to solve problems (e.g., math, data processing). Traditional sandboxing (Docker, Firecracker) has significant overhead. Monty offers a "sandbox-in-a-sandbox" approach that is lightweight enough to be part of the inner loop of an LLM interaction.
