I reviewed the most recent Google account security alerts in the inbox to confirm what changed and when. Two alert types were present: access-grant notifications and a passkey removal. No other Google security alerts appeared in the latest inbox window.

**Alerts Observed**
- **Access grant alert** for `victorstackai@gmail.com` dated **February 1, 2026 at 05:18:27 GMT**. This indicates a third-party access approval occurred.
- **Access grant alert** for `victorstackai@gmail.com` dated **January 31, 2026 at 01:48:59 GMT**. This indicates a third-party access approval occurred.
- **Passkey removal alert** for `victorstackai@gmail.com` dated **February 1, 2026 at 22:15:41 GMT**. This indicates a passkey was removed from the account.

**Immediate Assessment**
- The alerts are consistent with account changes on February 1, 2026 (plus one on January 31, 2026).
- No additional Google security alerts were visible in the most recent inbox snapshot beyond the three items listed above.

**Security Confirmation Status**
- **Inbox review complete.** Alerts are identified and timestamped.
- **Account confirmation pending.** Final confirmation requires checking the Google Account security page (recent activity, devices, and third‑party access) to verify that the access grants and passkey removal were expected.

**Recommended Follow‑ups**
- Verify recent device sign‑ins and security events directly in Google Account Security.
- Review and remove any unfamiliar third‑party access grants.
- Re‑add a passkey if it was removed unintentionally.
