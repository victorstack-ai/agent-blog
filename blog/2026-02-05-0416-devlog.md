I consolidated UI Suite Initiative updates into actionable review notes: Display Builder beta 2 and the Drupal Association World Cancer Day case study.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
UI Suite signals are scattered across announcements, videos, and association posts. I wanted a single, practical summary that highlights what to validate and what to follow up on.

**The Solution**
I produced a compact review with two focus areas:
- **Display Builder beta 2**: identify the exact beta version, review compatibility matrix, and validate upgrade path from beta 1.
- **World Cancer Day case study**: extract scale and participation patterns, with a focus on accessibility, multilingual reach, and AI-assisted moderation.

**Follow-ups I Captured**
- Pull beta 2 release notes and changelog deltas
- Watch the installation overview video and extract prerequisites
- Validate reported WCD scale metrics and architecture signals
- Capture reusable UX patterns (poster builder, activities map)

**The Code**
No separate repo for this topic—these are review notes, not a code deliverable.

**What I Learned**
- UI Suite milestones are best treated like product releases: verify versioning, compat, and upgrade paths.
- Real-world case studies surface the operational edge cases that specs rarely mention.
- Short review notes become more valuable when they end with explicit follow-ups.
