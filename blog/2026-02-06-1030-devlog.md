**The Hook**
DDEV 1.25.0 finally makes rootless and Podman a first-class path, which matters if you care about secure dev environments without Docker daemon privileges.

**Why I Built It**
I keep seeing teams block local dev on security grounds: Docker-in-Docker on CI, locked-down laptops, or corporate policies that forbid rootful daemons. DDEV’s move toward rootless and Podman isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s the difference between “dev env as a standard” and “dev env as an exception.” I wanted to map out when this is actually viable and where it still bites.

**The Solution**
DDEV 1.25.0 lands on a pragmatic stance: add Podman and rootless Docker support as experimental paths, but keep sane defaults for most devs. The core idea is to widen the compatibility matrix without forcing everyone off Docker.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Start] --> B{Platform + Policy};
  B -- Docker allowed --> C[Docker (rootful)];
  B -- Docker restricted --> D[Rootless Docker];
  B -- Prefer Podman --> E[Podman];
  C --> F[DDEV 1.25.0];
  D --> F;
  E --> F;
  F --> G[Project dev environment];
```

:::warning
Rootless and Podman are still experimental in DDEV 1.25.0. Expect edge-case breakage, especially around networking and volume permissions.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="rootless" label="Rootless Docker">
    ```bash
    # Rootless Docker path: good security posture, weaker defaults
    ddev config
    ddev start
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="podman" label="Podman">
    ```bash
    # Podman path: clean daemon model, but API parity is not perfect
    ddev config
    ddev start
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The sharp edge is parity: DDEV assumes Docker-ish behavior, so Podman and rootless are “compatible enough,” not “identical.” This is fine for most stacks, but it can fall over if your project depends on tight file permission semantics, custom network drivers, or heavyweight bind mounts.

:::tip
If you’re targeting locked-down laptops or enterprise environments, make rootless or Podman your default in docs. Otherwise you’ll lose days to “it works on my machine.”

**The Code**
No separate repo for this topic—this is about evaluating platform support rather than shipping new code.

**What I Learned**
- Rootless is a real option now, but the trade-off is weaker defaults and more permission friction—test your stack before promising it.
- Podman support is viable for many setups, but API parity gaps still matter when your stack uses edge Docker features.
- “Experimental support” means “usable with guardrails,” not “drop-in replacement.” Set expectations in your team docs.
