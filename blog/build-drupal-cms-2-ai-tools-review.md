I built **drupal-cms-2-ai-tools-review** as a focused review project for Drupal CMS 2 AI tooling, aimed at validating how AI-assisted workflows can fit into real Drupal 2.x delivery without breaking existing patterns. It’s a small, pragmatic repo that captures findings and examples rather than trying to be a framework.

The value is straightforward: it centralizes evaluation and notes so future Drupal work doesn’t repeat the same discovery and tradeoff analysis. If you’re deciding which AI tools to use for Drupal content modeling, editor workflows, or integration scaffolding, this repo gives a compact place to compare what works and what doesn’t.

One technical takeaway is to treat AI tooling in Drupal CMS 2 as an additive layer: keep your content model and integration boundaries stable, then bolt AI behaviors on as configurable services. That approach keeps the project maintainable even as AI tooling changes, and it makes experimentation low-risk.
