I mapped an intent-first framework for Elementor AI so outputs stay backward compatible, auditable, and reusable.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
Elementor’s AI direction is powerful, but without a stable intent contract it risks generating fragile layouts. I wanted a minimal, explicit model that keeps AI output aligned with real design tokens.

**The Solution**
I drafted four lightweight prototypes:
- **Site Intent Schema**: brand voice, colors, density, hierarchy, priorities, accessibility
- **Block-Level Suggestions**: scoring rules for layout density, contrast, and heading depth
- **Onboarding Flow**: capture intent, map to tokens, generate an annotated draft
- **Abilities Registry**: a contract for third-party capabilities and inputs/outputs

**MVP Build Path**
- Create intent schema + validator
- Add two layout presets tied to intent tokens
- Produce a suggestion report from mock content

**The Code**

**What I Learned**
- Intent schemas make AI output explainable and versionable.
- Small, explicit contracts reduce “magic” in AI-driven design changes.
- Backward compatibility is a product requirement, not an implementation detail.
