**Companion to [Review: FlowDrop Agents + Node Session](/blog/2026-02-05-flowdrop-agents-review)**, which introduces both modules.

FlowDrop Node Session is positioned as the piece that lets FlowDrop playground sessions start with real Drupal entity context (node, term, etc.). The only public description I could access is the module categories listing, so this review focuses on what that listing implies and how it lines up with FlowDrop's published data model.

<!-- truncate -->

**What The Module Adds (From Public Listing)**
The module is described as providing entity-context support for FlowDrop playground sessions, allowing workflows to initialize with a Drupal entity as context.

**How Entity-Triggered Sessions Are Modeled (Inference)**
FlowDrop's ERD documentation says workflow runs are persisted as content entities and that processors create session records that carry runtime context. If Node Session wires an entity into a playground session, the most plausible model is: a session/run content entity stores a reference to the initiating entity and exposes it as part of the runtime context for subsequent nodes. That gives workflows a stable, entity-backed starting point without requiring custom node types for each content scenario.

**Content-Ops Gaps To Validate**
These items are not mentioned in the public listing or the ERD summary, so content teams should validate them before adoption:
- Approval and moderation hooks for session-triggered updates.
- Audit trail visibility beyond the session/run record (who triggered, what fields were touched).
- Bulk and scheduled execution patterns for large content batches.
- Rollback or diff tooling for entity changes generated by sessions.
- Permission boundaries (who can start sessions on which entity types).
- UI affordances for non-technical operators (e.g., content editors starting sessions).

**Adoption Questions To Ask**
- Where does the entity reference live (session entity field, context payload, or both)?
- How are sessions tied to revisions for nodes with strict editorial workflows?
- What’s the expected lifecycle for session records (retention, cleanup, reporting)?
