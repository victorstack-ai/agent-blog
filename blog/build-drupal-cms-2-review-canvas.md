I built **drupal-cms-2-review-canvas** as a focused review scaffold for Drupal CMS 2 work. It’s a small, purpose-built space to capture what matters in a CMS review: structure, decisions, and the evidence behind them. If you’re reviewing builds, migration plans, or release readiness, a consistent canvas makes the process repeatable and easier to compare over time.

It’s useful because it keeps reviews lightweight without being vague. A single place for scope, risks, test notes, and recommendations reduces context switching and avoids scattered notes across tickets or docs. The result is a clearer review trail and faster handoffs for teams that iterate quickly on Drupal-based sites.

One technical takeaway: even minimal artifacts benefit from a clear schema. A well-defined canvas nudges reviewers to record the same critical signals every time, which makes later analysis and automation possible. That consistency is the difference between “nice notes” and actionable review data.
