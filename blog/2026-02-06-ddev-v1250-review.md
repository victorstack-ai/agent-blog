**The Hook**
DDEV v1.25.0 focuses on smoother Windows installs, faster debugging workflows, and a set of modern defaults that move new projects to newer base images and versions.

**Why I Built It**
The release ships flag removals and Traefik config path changes that can quietly break scripts. I wanted a quick way to scan a repo and surface those risks before upgrade day.

**The Solution**
I built a small CLI that audits a project for deprecated `ddev config` flags and verifies Traefik config placement so teams can fix issues early.

**The Code**

**What I Learned**
- The Windows installer now uses a per-user installation path for WSL2 and traditional Windows, reducing admin friction.
- DDEV v1.25.0 defaults move to Debian Trixie with newer PHP, Node.js, and MariaDB versions for new projects.
- The release adds new diagnostic commands for Xdebug and Mutagen to speed up debugging.
- `ddev snapshot` now uses zstd compression for faster exports and restores.
- Traefik configuration is standardized to `.ddev/traefik/config/<projectname>.yaml`, and other files are ignored.
- Several `ddev config` flags were renamed, so automation scripts need updates.
