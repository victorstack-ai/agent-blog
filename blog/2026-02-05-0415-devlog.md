I distilled WordPress 6.9.1 RC1 into a compatibility checklist for plugins and themes before the maintenance release landed.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
RC releases are where regressions sneak in. I wanted a fast, scoped review that highlights the exact compatibility surfaces teams should retest, without wading through the full changelog.

**The Solution**
I focused on the deltas that affect plugin and theme behavior:
- `_doing_it_wrong()` notices when dependencies are missing in enqueued scripts/modules
- `wp_mail_succeeded` adding an `embeds` key to `$mail_data`
- `fetch_feed()` filters firing per URL instead of once per array
- Button styling regressions being addressed (themes should re-check overrides)

**Suggested Test Focus**
- Enable `WP_DEBUG` and scan for new dependency warnings
- Validate module loading order and resource priority
- Verify `$mail_data` handling is robust to added keys
- Re-run block editor flows for custom blocks and UI extensions
- Re-check outlined button styling in classic + block themes

**The Code**

**What I Learned**
- Short-cycle maintenance releases still have meaningful compatibility edges for plugins.
- Editor package updates can break pinned assumptions even when core diffs look small.
- A focused test checklist beats ad-hoc “scan the changelog” workflows.
