## The Hook
Infrastructure is never "finished"; it’s either evolving or expiring, as IBM Cloud’s latest EOS notices and global DevOps shifts remind us.

## Why I Built It
No separate repo—this is a roundup of industry shifts in infrastructure and talent development that caught my eye today. While I’ve been deep in the weeds with AI agents lately, these updates are a stark reminder that the "stack" we build on requires constant maintenance and a fresh influx of talent.

## The Solution
Navigating the modern infrastructure landscape requires balancing three distinct forces: the inevitable decay of legacy services, the push for centralized efficiency, and the long-term play for talent.

### 1. The IBM Cloud Sunset
IBM Cloud released a series of End of Support (EOS) notices this month. For many, EOS is a source of anxiety, but I view it as a necessary forcing function. Keeping legacy services on life support is a silent tax on innovation. If you're still running on soon-to-be-deprecated IBM Cloud instances, the "solution" isn't just migration—it's an opportunity to re-architect for modern containerization.

### 2. Centralizing the Backbone: CEVA Logistics
CEVA Logistics recently announced a massive overhaul of their digital backbone, moving toward a centralized DevOps team. This is a classic architectural trade-off. 

| Approach | Benefit | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Centralized** | Uniform standards, shared security protocols, cost efficiency. | Potential bottleneck for individual product teams; "one size fits none." |
| **Decentralized** | High agility, team-specific tooling, fast iteration. | "Shadow IT," fragmented security, redundant infrastructure costs. |

CEVA is betting on the former to stabilize their global operations. For an indie dev, this might look like overkill, but at scale, "centralization" is often just another word for "reliability."

### 3. Scaling the Talent: Azerbaijan’s IT SkillSprint
The most ambitious "infrastructure" project I saw today wasn't code—it was people. Azerbaijan’s IT SkillSprint is engaging 10,000 students in DevOps training. This is a national-level infrastructure play. We can automate a lot of things, but we can't automate the architectural judgment needed to run these systems.

## The Code
No separate repo—this post is a synthesis of industry developments and strategic shifts in the DevOps and Cloud sectors.

## What I Learned
- **EOS is a Feature:** Don't fear the sunset. Treat End of Support notices as a scheduled cleanup of your technical debt.
- **Centralize for Stability, Decentralize for Speed:** If your infrastructure is currently a "wild west" of different configurations, a centralized DevOps effort (like CEVA's) is the right move to build a baseline.
- **Talent is the Real Bottleneck:** No matter how good your CI/CD pipeline is, the lack of skilled operators is the biggest risk to any digital transformation. Initiatives like the IT SkillSprint are essential, not optional.
