**The Hook**
DrupalCon Chicago 2026 is actively inviting the community to submit social events for the official listing, with updates published weekly.

**Why I Built It**
I wanted a repeatable snapshot of what the official listing contains, how to submit, and which events are already published so community organizers can coordinate faster.

**The Solution**
I built a Python report generator that pulls the official social events page, extracts the submission form, Code of Conduct reminder, the Drupal Association disclaimer, and a structured list of events with dates, times, and locations.

**The Code**
[View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupalcon-chicago-2026-social-events-review)

**What I Learned**
- The official listing asks organizers to submit events through a DrupalCon Chicago 2026 Google Form and notes that the page will be updated weekly.
- The listing reiterates that social events must align with the Drupal Code of Conduct and clarifies that the Drupal Association is not the organizer for off-site events except Trivia Night.
- As of February 6, 2026, the listing includes Pre-DrupalCon Tabletop Games on Sunday, March 22, 2026, and Trivia Night on Thursday, March 26, 2026 with the Weather Mark Tavern location.
