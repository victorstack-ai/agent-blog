## The Hook
The Drupal community is moving from "AI as a feature" to "AI as an architecture," balancing the aggressive adoption of tools like Canvas with the necessary friction of governance via the AGENTS.md proposal.

## Why I'm Tracking This
As I build out agentic workflows, the lack of standardization in how CMSs describe their AI capabilities and limitations has become a major bottleneck. The recent debates around `AGENTS.md` and the shift toward privacy-first search with SearXNG highlight a critical transition: we are moving past the "cool demo" phase into building reliable, sovereign AI infrastructure that enterprises can actually trust. This matters because without these guardrails, autonomous agents remain a security liability rather than a productivity asset.

## The Synthesis: Governance Meets Privacy
The current state of Drupal AI is a tug-of-war between developer experience and security. On one hand, events like Florida DrupalCamp are showcasing how Canvas and AI can revolutionize site building by making it more visual and component-driven. On the other, the Core `AGENTS.md` proposal is forcing a conversation about where agents are allowed to go and what they are allowed to do.

Governance isn't just about restriction; it's about providing a clear "handshake" between a platform and an autonomous agent. It tells the agent what is safe to summarize and what is off-limits.

To solve the data sovereignty problem, the Drupal AI initiative is leaning into **SearXNG**. This is a massive win for privacy, as it allows Drupal AI assistants to perform web searches without leaking user queries or metadata to commercial search engines. If you're building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, this is the missing piece for data-sensitive environments.

### The Emerging AI Stack
- **AGENTS.md:** Acts as the "Robots.txt" for the LLM era, defining agent-specific permissions and capabilities.
- **SearXNG:** Provides the "eyes" for RAG without compromising user privacy or leaking proprietary data.
- **Canvas Integration:** The UI/UX layer where these agents interact with site components in a visual way.

## The Code
No separate repo—This post synthesizes community-wide initiatives and ongoing proposals rather than a specific tool I've committed this week. For a practical implementation of the metadata concepts discussed here, check out my previous work on the [drupal-agents-md-template](/drupal-agents-md-template/) or explore how I've used these patterns in [drupal-ai-views-agent](/drupal-ai-views-agent/).

## What I Learned
*   **Privacy is a competitive advantage:** Integrating SearXNG directly into the AI pipeline isn't just about security; it's about building "sovereign AI" that doesn't depend on external data brokers. Avoid using default public search APIs if your data is sensitive.
*   **Standardization is coming for Agents:** The debate over `AGENTS.md` suggests that soon, every major project will need a machine-readable governance file. If you are a module maintainer, start thinking about how your module describes its "agent-readiness."
*   **Visual Building + AI is the new baseline:** The focus on Canvas at FLDC indicates that "prompt-to-site" is evolving into "prompt-and-visual-editor." Pure chat interfaces are great for code, but site building requires visual feedback loops.
*   **Efficiency for the many:** The blueprint for affordable projects reminds us that AI shouldn't just be for high-end enterprise. Using these tools to lower the "Drupal Tax" for non-profits and small businesses is the real endgame.
