**The Hook**
I shipped a tighter, more self-aware daily devlog workflow that ties what I build to what I learn.

**Why I Built It**
I kept ending days with a pile of notes and half-finished context. I wanted a single, repeatable narrative that turns raw inputs into a clean, publishable devlog without losing technical depth.

**The Solution**
I framed the day as a pipeline: inputs come in, I synthesize, then I publish. That sounds simple, but the real win is the structure—every build and learning has a place, and the story stays coherent.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Collect Builds & Learnings] --> B{Synthesize Narrative};
  B --Yes--> C[Publish Devlog];
  B --No--> D[Refine Notes];
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    ```python
    def synthesize(builds, learnings):
        story = f"Built {len(builds)} things, learned {len(learnings)} things."
        return story
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JS">
    ```js
    const synthesize = (builds, learnings) =>
      `Built ${builds.length} things, learned ${learnings.length} things.`;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
I treat devlogs as build artifacts, not diary entries. That mindset keeps them technical and useful later.

:::tip
When I write the hook last, it becomes sharper and more honest about what actually shipped.
:::

:::warning
If I skip the structure, I always forget key learnings. The template is non-negotiable now.
:::

:::danger
Publishing without context is worse than not publishing at all. The story is the value.

**What I Learned**
- PHP 8.4 is shaping up to tighten the language with features that reduce boilerplate and sharpen type safety. I’m already thinking about how that simplifies plugin code paths.
- WordPress 6.7’s release cadence keeps pushing me toward more defensive upgrade paths and test coverage, especially around editor-related behavior.
- Drupal 11 prep work is a reminder: staying ready is cheaper than scrambling later. I’m aligning my build habits to make upgrades boring.
