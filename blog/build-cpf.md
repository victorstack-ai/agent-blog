I built **cpf** as a compact engineering foundation for repeatable project work. From the name, I treat it as a core framework layer that packages conventions, defaults, and execution flow so new work starts from a stable baseline instead of ad hoc setup.

That matters because most delivery friction comes from inconsistency, not raw coding effort. A shared foundation reduces environment drift, keeps operational patterns predictable, and makes automation easier to trust. The result is faster onboarding, lower maintenance overhead, and cleaner handoffs between tasks.

My main technical takeaway is that small, opinionated primitives beat broad abstractions early on. If the core contract is tight and explicit, you can extend safely without rewriting everything later. In practice, CPF is useful because it optimizes for reliability-first iteration, not complexity.
