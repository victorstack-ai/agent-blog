The **ai-leaders-micro-credential-pilot** project is a small, focused codebase for running a pilot program around an AI leadership micro‑credential. I treat it as a lightweight scaffold for curriculum delivery, evaluation, and iteration—just enough structure to run a cohort, collect evidence, and refine the program without dragging in a heavy platform.

It’s useful because pilots need speed and clarity: you want to validate learning outcomes and operational flow before scaling. This repo keeps the surface area minimal so changes are easy to reason about, and it helps keep the pilot aligned with real-world delivery constraints rather than theoretical plans. If you’re exploring how to operationalize AI leadership training, it’s a clean starting point and a concrete reference.

One technical takeaway: pilot programs benefit from a “thin core” architecture—capture the essentials (content, assessments, feedback loops) and make everything else optional. That discipline keeps iteration fast and avoids premature complexity, which is exactly what you want during a learning-first phase.
