I outlined a practical stack for multilingual HTML email in Drupal using Mail Composer plus a dedicated HTML mailer, and packaged it as a small demo repo you can reference.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
Drupal mail APIs are flexible, but multilingual HTML email becomes messy without a clear composition pattern. I wanted a repeatable blueprint: compose once, render per language, and deliver with predictable theming.

**The Solution**
I captured a lightweight decision tree:
- **Mail Composer** for object-oriented message composition
- **Mailer Plus (Symfony Mailer)** if you need modern HTML rendering + Twig templates
- **Mail System + HTML Mail/Mime Mail** if that stack already exists
- **Language flow**: resolve recipient langcode → render templates in that language → pass langcode to MailManager

**Recommended Flow**
1. Determine recipient language (`$langcode`).
2. Build the Mail Composer message in that language context.
3. Render HTML + text templates in that language.
4. Send via MailManager using `$langcode`.

**The Code**
I built a small module/demo so the flow is tangible. You can clone it or browse the key files here: [View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-multilingual-html-email-example)

**What I Learned**
- Mail Composer is a composition layer, not an HTML renderer, so pairing matters.
- Multilingual strategy is easiest when language resolution is explicit and early.
- A clear decision guide avoids “half migrations” between mail stacks.
