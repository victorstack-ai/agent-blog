The PHP world doesn't sleep. Today brought a critical wave of security patches across the entire Symfony ecosystem (from 5.4 LTS to 8.0) and a forward-looking release from Pantheon's Terminus CLI adding support for the upcoming PHP 8.5.

## Why I'm Flagging This

Dependency management is often "set and forget" until a CVE hits. The sheer breadth of today's Symfony security release—touching five major branches—is a reminder that even stable, mature frameworks have surface area that needs constant watching.

Simultaneously, seeing platform tools like Terminus prep for PHP 8.5 (while many of us are just settling into 8.3/8.4) signals that the infrastructure layer is moving fast. If your tooling lags, your ability to test new features lags.

## The Solution: Patching & Upgrading

### Symfony Security Sweep

The Symfony team released versions 8.0.5, 7.4.5, 7.3.11, 6.4.33, and 5.4.51. These aren't feature drops; they are security hardenings. If you are running a composer-based project (Laravel, Drupal, native Symfony), you need to verify your lock file isn't pinning a vulnerable version.

    ```bash
    # Check for known security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
    composer audit
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="update" label="Update Symfony">
    ```bash
    # Update only symfony packages
    composer update "symfony/*" --with-dependencies
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Terminus & PHP 8.5

Pantheon's CLI tool, Terminus, bumped to 4.1.4. The headline feature is PHP 8.5 support. While PHP 8.5 is still in early development phases, having CI/CD tools that can handle the runtime is essential for early adopters testing compatibility.

:::tip
Always check your global CLI tool versions. It's easy to let them rot since they live outside your project's `composer.json`.
:::

```bash
# Check your current Terminus version
terminus --version

# Update Terminus (if installed via phar/installer)
terminus self:update
```

## The Code

No separate repo—this is a maintenance and infrastructure update cycle.

## What I Learned

*   **LTS is a commitment:** Seeing Symfony 5.4.51 in the release list proves the value of Long Term Support versions. You don't have to be on the bleeding edge to get security patches, but you *do* have to run the updates.
*   **Composer Audit is underused:** Running `composer audit` should be part of every CI pipeline. It catches these announcements instantly.
*   **Tooling leads runtimes:** Infrastructure CLIs (like Terminus) often need to support a language version *before* the application code does, so developers have a stable environment to break things in.
