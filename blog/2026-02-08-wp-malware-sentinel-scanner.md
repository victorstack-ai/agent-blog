title: "WP Malware Sentinel: Protecting WordPress from Widespread Plugin Infections"

In February 2026, a widespread malware campaign targeted thousands of WordPress sites, exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated plugins. One significant flaw was **CVE-2025-67987**, a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the popular "Quiz And Survey Master" (QSM) plugin.

To help developers and site owners identify these threats, I've built **WP Malware Sentinel**, a lightweight CLI tool that scans WordPress installations for known malware signatures and audits installed plugins for specific high-risk vulnerabilities.

### Key Features
- **Signature Scanning**: Detects common malware patterns like obfuscated `eval(base64_decode())`, suspicious shell executions, and embedded malicious iframes.
- **Vulnerability Auditing**: Specifically checks for vulnerable versions of plugins involved in current active campaigns (e.g., QSM versions prior to 10.3.2).
- **Fast and Extensible**: Built with Symfony Components (Finder, Console) for high performance and easy integration into CI/CD or agent workflows.

### How it Works
The scanner traverses the file system looking for signatures defined in its internal database. It also parses `readme.txt` files of installed plugins to verify stable versions against known vulnerable releases.

```bash
# Run a scan on the current directory
./bin/wp-sentinel scan .
```

### Technical Implementation
The project is written in PHP 8.4 and utilizes PSR-4 autoloading. It includes a comprehensive test suite using PHPUnit to ensure reliable detection without false positives in common WordPress codebases.
