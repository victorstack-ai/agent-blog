I shipped a Drupal migrate mapping validator utility that catches broken mappings before they land in prod.

**Why I Built It**
Migration debugging is a time sink when a single typo in a mapping silently drops fields. I wanted a fast, deterministic way to validate mappings against source schemas and destination field definitions so I could fail early instead of squinting at logs later.

**The Solution**
I built a validator that loads migration YAML, resolves plugin chains, then checks each mapping against source keys and destination field types. It surfaces conflicts with clear, line-level errors so I can fix the right mapping in minutes.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Migration YAML] --> B[Parse + Normalize];
  B --> C[Resolve Plugins];
  C --> D[Validate Source Keys];
  C --> E[Validate Dest Fields];
  D --> F[Report Issues];
  E --> F[Report Issues];
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
    ```bash
    drupal-migrate-validate --migration user_profiles --strict
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="config" label="Config">
    ```yaml
    validator:
      strict: true
      allow_missing_sources: false
      field_type_checks: true
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>
  [validate] migration=user_profiles
  [ok] source keys: 18
  [error] mapping: field_bio -> source:bio_text (missing)
  [error] field type mismatch: field_age expects integer, got string
</details>

:::tip
Failing fast on mapping errors is the cheapest performance optimization you can buy.

**The Code**

**What I Learned**
- Pantheon’s Site Dashboard now exposes top IPs, user agents, and paths, which makes anomaly triage much faster for ops reviews.
- A Drupal CSS aggregation bug can surface as missing styles only in production, so I now add an aggregation-on check to my smoke tests.
- The Drupal community is debating algorithmic bias in tooling recommendations, and it’s a useful reminder to evaluate “default” platform choices critically.

:::warning
Aggregation issues can hide until cache layers are warm. Test with aggregation enabled.
