I turned my Drupal Canvas Full HTML notes into a clear rollout guide so teams can ship rich editing without breaking permissions.
<!-- truncate -->

**Why I Built It**
Canvas ships with a powerful editor, but Full HTML in Canvas can be risky if the configuration is sloppy. I wanted a deterministic, step-by-step guide that makes the rollout safe and auditable.

**The Solution**
I distilled the guide into a predictable sequence:
- Validate prerequisites (Drupal 11.2+, Canvas 1.0.4, Full HTML text format)
- Install Canvas and Canvas Full HTML
- Enable Gin for a consistent editing baseline
- Configure Full HTML in Canvas and clear caches
- Verify component schemas expose `contentMediaType: text/html`
- Confirm Canvas AI behavior and prompting patterns for safe component use

```yaml
props:
  type: object
  properties:
    content:
      type: string
      title: Content
      contentMediaType: text/html
      x-formatting-context: block
```

**The Code**
No separate repo for this topic—this is a rollout guide, not a code deliverable.

**What I Learned**
- Canvas Full HTML supports Drupal ^10.3 and ^11, but stable Canvas targets ^11.2, so version alignment matters.
- The Gin admin theme materially improves the Canvas authoring experience.
- Canvas AI is safer when prompts emphasize placement over creation, reducing unintended component generation.
