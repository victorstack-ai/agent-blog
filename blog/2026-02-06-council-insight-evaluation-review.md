**The Hook**
David Bishop’s Council Insight reframes council website evaluation around real user journeys instead of surface-level performance scores.

**Why I Built It**
Council teams need a fast way to translate journey insights into prioritised fixes. I wanted a compact scoring toolkit that keeps the focus on task completion, clarity, and confidence—exactly the measures Council Insight emphasizes.

**The Solution**
I built a CLI scorecard that takes journey metrics and outputs an overall council score plus concrete recommendations for the weakest journeys. The weighting mirrors the Council Insight mindset: success rate first, then clarity, handoff quality, and resident confidence.

**The Code**

**What I Learned**
- Council Insight analyses common resident journeys across hundreds of UK council websites to surface where people struggle and why.
- The project’s focus on content clarity and confidence signals makes improvement work more actionable than raw technical audits.
- A lightweight scorecard can help teams track whether small content fixes are moving the needle month over month.
