`drupal-cms-ai-recipes-review` is a small, focused Drupal CMS review project that documents and validates a set of AI-oriented recipes for building common site features. I use it as a quick, repeatable way to check how recipe-based setups behave in real Drupal CMS installs without spinning up a large scaffold.

It’s useful because Drupal CMS recipes can drift as core, contrib, or tooling changes. A lightweight review repo makes it easy to spot breakage, confirm assumptions, and share what actually works right now, especially when AI-assisted workflows are involved.

Technical takeaway: recipe reviews are most valuable when they capture both the “happy path” and the sharp edges. Even a minimal repo can encode a reproducible checklist that saves time across multiple projects.
