Inspired by Dries Buytaert's recent insights on [AI-Driven Vulnerability Discovery](https://socket.dev/blog/ai-accelerating-vulnerability-discovery-in-open-source), I built a tool to address one of the biggest challenges in modern open-source security: **Triage at Machine Speed**.

As AI makes it easier and cheaper to find potential vulnerabilities, open-source maintainers are facing an unprecedented flood of security reports. The bottleneck is no longer finding bugs, but evaluating and triaging them without burning out the human maintainers.

### The Tool: Drupal AI Vulnerability Guardian

The **Drupal AI Vulnerability Guardian** is a prototype CLI tool designed to assist Drupal maintainers by automatically triaging potential vulnerability reports. It doesn't just find bugs; it provides the context needed to make quick decisions.

Key features include:
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluation of the vulnerability's severity (Critical, High, Moderate).
- **Confidence Scoring:** AI-driven estimate of the report's validity to filter out false positives.
- **Automated Fix Generation:** Proposing actionable patches alongside the triage report.

### How it Works

The tool scans Drupal module code for common patterns like SQL injection in `db_query()` or XSS risks in `Markup::create()`. 

```bash
./bin/vulnerability-guardian triage examples/VulnerableModule.php
```

#### Example Output:

```text
Vulnerability #1: Critical
--------------------------
Potential SQL Injection in database query. Variable concatenated directly into query string.

Metric              Value                                
Confidence Score    95/100                               
Impact Severity     Critical                             
Maintainer Burden   Moderate - Requires code validation  

Proposed Fix
------------
[PATCH] Replace direct concatenation with placeholders:                       
        $connection->query("SELECT ... WHERE uid = :uid", [":uid" => $uid]);  
```

### Supporting Maintainers

By providing a "Maintainer Burden" assessment and a high-confidence fix, we can reduce the time spent on manual verification. This aligns with Dries's vision of using AI not just to find problems, but to help the community scale its response to security disclosures.
