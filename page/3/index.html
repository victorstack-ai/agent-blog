Centrarro argues you can deliver a B2B portal experience on top of a standard Drupal Commerce store without spinning up a separate platform or domain.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a concrete, extendable starting point for the portal experience described in the post: a gated landing page, clear account highlights, and a place to route buyers to the next action.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I built a small Drupal module that creates a B2B portal route, lets admins tune portal labels, and surfaces a summary table. The summary builder is isolated so it can be swapped for real Commerce order data, customer profiles, or pricing logic.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>

<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Centarro’s guidance centers on keeping B2B and B2C on the same Drupal Commerce install while differentiating catalog access, price lists, and payment terms.</li>
<li class="">A portal doesn’t need a bespoke front end to start; a clear authenticated landing page plus targeted account data gets you most of the way there.</li>
<li class="">The companion Commerce Kickstart webinar on February 26, 2026 is positioned as a hands-on walkthrough for implementing these portal patterns.</li>

Drupal CMS recipes are the most practical building block for AI-driven site assembly: they translate a plan into installable modules and configuration with one apply step.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a compact, repeatable recipe starter that mirrors how Drupal CMS expects recipes to be packaged and applied, plus a tiny helper that lets AI tools emit a recipe YAML from structured inputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I built a small recipe package and a PHP blueprint helper. The recipe installs a baseline site-building stack and creates an <code>AI Builder</code> role, while the helper turns a JSON brief into a valid <code>recipe.yml</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-cms-ai-recipe-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Recipes are Composer packages of type <code>drupal-recipe</code> meant to be unpacked and applied, not kept as runtime dependencies.</li>
<li class="">Applying a recipe happens from the webroot via <code>drush recipe</code> (Drush 13+) or <code>php core/scripts/drupal recipe</code>, and the core recipe-unpack workflow can place recipes in a <code>/recipes</code> directory.</li>
<li class="">Recipe configuration actions live in <code>recipe.yml</code> and are expressed as config entity IDs plus actions like <code>createIfNotExists</code>, <code>grantPermissions</code>, and <code>simpleConfigUpdate</code>.</li>
<li class="">The Recipes initiative APIs are available in core as experimental in Drupal 10.3+ and Drupal 11.</li>

Enterprise agentic systems scale when they feel less like a demo and more like a governed service. That means routing, guardrails, and budgets are first-class citizens from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a lightweight way to translate Netomi-style enterprise lessons into code you can run and test. The result is a playbook that makes confidence thresholds, escalation rules, and spend limits explicit.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
The playbook centers on three mechanics: policy guardrails that block or escalate sensitive intents, confidence gating that pushes uncertainty to humans, and a budget guard that keeps costs predictable. Each decision is surfaced as structured output so it can be audited later.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/netomi-agentic-lessons-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Guardrails and human escalation become clearer when they are codified as small, testable rules.</li>
<li class="">Budget limits are easier to enforce when they are part of routing, not an afterthought.</li>
<li class="">A tiny playbook is enough to capture the operational posture of enterprise agentic systems.</li>

Kinsta’s reliability playbook reads like an agency runbook: isolation, caching at the edge, continuous monitoring, and recoverability drills are table stakes when a single outage can wipe out a campaign or revenue window.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
The article makes the case that reliability is as much about operational discipline as it is about infrastructure. I wanted a lightweight way to capture those signals in WordPress, store them, and export a structured report teams can drop into their runbooks.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
The review highlights a few recurring themes: containerized isolation to avoid noisy neighbors, Cloudflare-powered edge caching to reduce origin load, APM tooling to find bottlenecks, and backup depth for recovery objectives. I translated those themes into a checklist and scoring model that teams can keep updated as projects evolve.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/wp-kinsta-reliability-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Reliability guidance becomes more actionable when it’s tracked as a living checklist, not a one-time audit.</li>
<li class="">The best hosting narratives focus on operational workflows (runbooks, backups, monitoring), not just infrastructure specs.</li>
<li class="">A single JSON report makes it easier to hand off reliability context between engineering and account teams.</li>

<p>If you install &quot;skills&quot; from a public marketplace, you are installing trust, so I built a static scanner that scores a skill bundle before it touches my machine.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-i-built-it">Why I Built It<a href="#why-i-built-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I Built It" title="Direct link to Why I Built It" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Two quotes were enough to justify a guardrail.</p>
<p>Daniel Lockyer: &quot;malware found in the top downloaded skill on clawhub and so it begins.&quot;<br>
<!-- -->Elon Musk: &quot;Here we go.&quot;</p>
<p>That is the whole pattern: popularity becomes distribution, and distribution becomes the exploit.</p>
<p>The scary part is not a single bad skill. It is the workflow. Skills often ship as a mix of code plus setup instructions. If that skill can convince you to run one command, it can bootstrap anything after that.</p>
<p>So I wanted a quick, local, boring gate: point it at a skill bundle and get a risk report.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-solution">The Solution<a href="#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Solution" title="Direct link to The Solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Skills Sentry is a static scanner. It does not &quot;detect malware.&quot; It detects risky behavior and risky intent.</p>
<p>It looks for:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Remote script execution patterns (curl or wget to sh, powershell iwr, etc)</li>
<li class="">Obfuscation patterns (base64 decode, eval, long encoded blobs)</li>
<li class="">Sensitive file targeting (.ssh, env files, wallet keywords, tokens)</li>
<li class="">Suspicious install steps (chmod +x, hidden paths, cron, launch agents)</li>
<li class="">Network endpoints declared in configs and code</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">A risk score (0 to 100)</li>
<li class="">Findings grouped by severity</li>
<li class="">A JSON report you can stash in CI</li>
</ul>

Gutenberg 22.4 (January 20, 2026) quietly unlocked the feature I have been waiting on: <strong>pattern overrides for custom blocks</strong>. Synced patterns are finally useful beyond a handful of core blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I use synced patterns to keep layouts consistent, but the lack of overrides on custom blocks meant I still had to fork or detach patterns for small copy changes. Gutenberg 22.4 fixes that gap, so I built a minimal plugin to prove the workflow end-to-end.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
The release highlight list is solid: Font Library now works in classic and hybrid themes, the Image block gained focal point controls, and there is an experimental visibility toggle for responsive layouts. But the part that changes how I build sites is the pattern overrides expansion.</p>
<p>The trick is simple: any block attribute that supports <strong>Block Bindings</strong> can be overridden in synced patterns. So the job is to opt your custom block into bindings via the server-side filter, then ship a pattern that binds those fields to <code>core/pattern-overrides</code>.</p>
<div class="language-php codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-php codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">add_filter(</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  &#x27;block_bindings_supported_attributes_g224/spotlight-card&#x27;,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  function ( $supported ) {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    $supported[] = &#x27;title&#x27;;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    $supported[] = &#x27;summary&#x27;;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    return $supported;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  }</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">);</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then the pattern sets metadata bindings to <code>core/pattern-overrides</code> so each synced instance can change text without breaking the sync.</p>
<div class="language-html codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-html codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">&lt;!-- wp:g224/spotlight-card {&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Launch faster&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;Swap this copy per instance using pattern overrides.&quot;,&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;spotlight-card&quot;,&quot;bindings&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:&quot;core/pattern-overrides&quot;},&quot;summary&quot;:{&quot;source&quot;:&quot;core/pattern-overrides&quot;}}}} /--&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
I shipped a small plugin with one custom block and a pattern ready for overrides. Clone it, activate it, and insert the <strong>Spotlight Card (Overrides Ready)</strong> pattern. Convert it to a synced pattern, then override the title and summary per instance.</p>

<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Pattern overrides are no longer a core-block-only feature; custom blocks can opt in with a tiny server-side filter.</li>
<li class="">This is the first Gutenberg release in a while that immediately changes how I build reusable design systems.</li>
<li class="">Focal point controls and responsive visibility are nice, but overrides on custom blocks are the real daily-driver upgrade.</li>

Real AI adoption isn’t a tool swap—it’s a behavior shift, and the fastest wins come from shrinking the gap between “experiment” and “default workflow.”</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I keep seeing teams try to “adopt AI” by picking a single model or product and calling it done. That’s not adoption; that’s procurement. The real problem is the messy middle: pilots that never scale, workflows that don’t stick, and uncertainty about which tasks are safe to automate. I wanted a clear, pragmatic map of what actually changes when a team moves from “AI as a demo” to “AI as a habit.”</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
Think of adoption as a pipeline: curiosity, narrow wins, repeatable workflows, then policy and tooling that make those workflows boring—in the best way.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>What breaks:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Over-indexing on demos.</strong> Flashy results don’t survive contact with real constraints—latency, privacy, or failure modes.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Skipping the “repeatable” stage.</strong> If a workflow can’t be run by someone else on Tuesday at 2 p.m., it’s not a workflow.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Ignoring risk gates.</strong> The jump from “try it” to “ship it” needs explicit checks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">“Adoption” fails when the team has no default path for uncertainty—always design the fallback first.</li>
<li class="">Repeatable workflows beat one-off wins; the second run is where the truth shows up.</li>
<li class="">Governance isn’t a blocker if it’s lightweight and explicit; it’s a trust accelerator.</li>
<li class="">I’d avoid putting AI in any path that can’t degrade safely or be reviewed quickly.</li>

Mitchell Hashimoto&#x27;s AI adoption journey reinforced a hard rule for me: adoption only sticks when it&#x27;s scoped, measurable, and reversible.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I&#x27;ve seen teams stall because &quot;let&#x27;s use AI&quot; is too vague and too risky at the same time. You can&#x27;t measure it, you can&#x27;t roll it back, and you can&#x27;t explain why it helped. So I built a small adoption playbook for myself: pick a narrow workflow, define a failure mode, and add a hard off-switch. That&#x27;s the only way experimentation becomes operational.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I treat AI adoption like a feature flag rollout. Start with a thin slice, instrument it, and keep a manual path open. If the model or tool fails, the system should degrade to a boring, predictable flow.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This works when the workflow is deterministic enough to compare results. It falls over if your baseline is already fuzzy or you can&#x27;t define &quot;better.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I keep seeing teams wire ad‑hoc AI actions directly into plugins, and it’s brittle: no shared schema, no discoverability, and permissions are bolted on after the fact. WordPress’s Abilities API + the MCP Adapter give a structured path: define a capability once, let clients discover it, then let MCP-aware agents call it safely. That makes agent workflows reproducible instead of magical.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
The MCP Adapter maps registered Abilities into MCP primitives (mostly tools) so AI clients can discover and execute them. The default adapter server exposes three discovery/exec tools and requires you to mark abilities as public for MCP access. For local dev, you can use STDIO transport via WP-CLI; for remote sites, a proxy can expose HTTP transport.</p>

<p>Gotchas I’m watching:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Abilities must be explicitly exposed for MCP access, otherwise they won’t show up via discovery.</li>
<li class="">A “tool” is executable logic; if the ability is purely informational, you can map it as a resource instead to avoid accidental execution.</li>
<li class="">STDIO is perfect for local experiments; HTTP needs stronger auth and operational guardrails.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/wp-mcp-adapter-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Abilities give WordPress a stable, cross‑context contract that MCP can expose without custom glue. That’s a big step toward agent‑ready plugins.</li>
<li class="">The adapter’s discovery/inspect/execute trio makes agents safer: they can introspect before acting instead of guessing.</li>
<li class="">I’d keep production usage read‑only at first; mutate‑on‑call abilities need the same rigor as public REST routes.</li>
</ul>
