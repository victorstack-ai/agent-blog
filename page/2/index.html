class="markdown"><p><strong>drupal-cms-2-ai-agent-poc</strong> is a proof‑of‑concept that connects Drupal CMS to an AI agent workflow. From the name, I’m treating it as a focused bridge: a Drupal-side surface area that can invoke, coordinate, or integrate with agent logic for content or automation tasks.</p>
<p>Why it’s useful: Drupal teams often need repeatable, safe automation around content ops, migrations, or editorial workflows. A small POC like this is the right way to validate how agent-driven actions can plug into Drupal without over‑committing to a full platform redesign.</p>
<p>One technical takeaway: keep the integration seam narrow and explicit. A thin module or service layer that exposes a minimal API for agent tasks makes it easier to test, secure, and evolve over time—especially when agent behavior changes.</p>

It’s a small, pragmatic repo that captures findings and examples rather than trying to be a framework.</p>
<p>The value is straightforward: it centralizes evaluation and notes so future Drupal work doesn’t repeat the same discovery and tradeoff analysis. If you’re deciding which AI tools to use for Drupal content modeling, editor workflows, or integration scaffolding, this repo gives a compact place to compare what works and what doesn’t. <a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-cms-2-ai-tools-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p>One technical takeaway is to treat AI tooling in Drupal CMS 2 as an additive layer: keep your content model and integration boundaries stable, then bolt AI behaviors on as configurable services. That approach keeps the project maintainable even as AI tooling changes, and it makes experimentation low-risk.</p>

It’s a small, purpose-built space to capture what matters in a CMS review: structure, decisions, and the evidence behind them. If you’re reviewing builds, migration plans, or release readiness, a consistent canvas makes the process repeatable and easier to compare over time.</p>
<p>It’s useful because it keeps reviews lightweight without being vague. A single place for scope, risks, test notes, and recommendations reduces context switching and avoids scattered notes across tickets or docs. The result is a clearer review trail and faster handoffs for teams that iterate quickly on Drupal-based sites.</p>
<p>One technical takeaway: even minimal artifacts benefit from a clear schema. A well-defined canvas nudges reviewers to record the same critical signals every time, which makes later analysis and automation possible. That consistency is the difference between “nice notes” and actionable review data.</p>

It aims to keep CSS/JS aggregation reliable and safe under real-world deployments, where caches, build artifacts, and file permissions can drift. If you’ve ever had a site render fine locally but break after a deploy, this kind of guardrail is the missing layer.</p>
<p>The value is in predictable behavior: when aggregation goes sideways, you want the site to fail gracefully or self-correct rather than silently serve broken assets. The module is meant to tighten that gap, especially in automated pipelines where you can’t babysit cache rebuilds. <a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-aggregation-guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p>Technical takeaway: treat aggregated assets as a stateful artifact, not a guaranteed side effect. That means verifying preconditions (writable directories, expected hashes, and cache integrity) and making failures visible early instead of letting them leak into production.</p>

<p>It is useful when teams want consistent, AI-assisted drafts that still live in Drupal’s content model, permissions, and review flow.

I built it to take the repetitive, error-prone parts of module setup—info files, boilerplate, and consistent structure—and make them fast and repeatable. It fits naturally into agent-driven workflows where you want consistent Drupal modules without losing time to manual setup.</p>
<p>It’s useful because it standardizes the starting point for modules and makes the first commit reliable. That means less time redoing file structures, fewer mistakes in module metadata, and a faster path from idea to a working, testable Drupal feature. If you’re iterating on multiple modules or experiments, the generator pays off almost immediately.</p>
<p>The key technical takeaway is that pairing MCP with a targeted generator creates a clear contract between intent and output. You define the module intent, and the generator enforces a predictable Drupal skeleton that downstream tools can build on. That makes subsequent automation—tests, linting, and CI checks—much easier to wire in.</p>

It sits at the intersection of Drupal’s Views UI and AI-driven intent parsing, so you can describe what you want and let the agent assemble the View structure.</p>
<p>It’s useful because Views is powerful but often repetitive: filters, relationships, display modes, and fields add up quickly. By automating that scaffolding, the project can speed up prototyping, reduce manual clicks, and keep teams focused on validating data requirements instead of wrestling with UI details.</p>
<p>A technical takeaway: agent workflows are most effective when they output structured configuration that maps cleanly onto Drupal’s internal APIs. That makes it easier to validate, version, and refine the generated Views without losing the benefits of automation.</p>

<p>It’s useful because it narrows the feedback loop for QA: I can verify content modeling, editorial flow, and UI behavior in isolation, then carry what works into larger Drupal builds. That keeps regression testing tight and helps confirm that the CMS’s out‑of‑the‑box capabilities can support a clean blog workflow.</p>
<p>One takeaway: a focused QA repo like this is a reliable way to test core Drupal patterns before committing them to a production codebase. It’s faster to validate assumptions in a minimal environment than to unwind them later in a full project.</p>

It likely provides the glue code and conventions to host an agent SDK runtime in the Drupal ecosystem, so you can build Drupal features that call agent capabilities without reinventing the runtime plumbing.</p>
<p>That is useful when you want structured, repeatable agent behaviors inside Drupal: content automation, editorial assistance, or backend workflows that need deterministic integration points. A runtime package keeps the boundaries clear—Drupal provides the context and storage, the runtime provides the agent execution surface—so you can iterate on prompts and tools without re-architecting the integration.</p>
<p>Technical takeaway: treat the runtime as an integration contract. Keep Drupal-specific concerns (services, config, entities) on one side and agent execution (sessions, tool calls, output handling) on the other, and you get a clean seam for testing and future upgrades.

DDEV 1.25.0 ships experimental support for Podman and Docker rootless, opening up new corporate-friendly runtimes while introducing a few practical trade-offs.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
The Podman and rootless workflows depend on specific global settings (ports, mount mode). I wanted a fast, repeatable way to confirm a workstation is configured before teams flip the switch.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I built a CLI that audits <code>global_config.yaml</code> and flags missing settings for Podman or Docker rootless, with a focused checklist for macOS Podman users.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-ddev-podman-rootless-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">DDEV 1.25.0 adds experimental support for both Podman and Docker rootless.</li>
<li class="">Podman on macOS cannot bind to ports 80/443, so DDEV needs router ports set to 8080/8443.</li>
<li class="">Docker rootless cannot use bind mounts, so <code>no-bind-mounts</code> mode is required.</li>
<li class="">DDEV global configuration lives in <code>global_config.yaml</code>, and the config can live under <code>$HOME/.ddev</code> or an XDG location.</li>

I treat it as a lightweight scaffold for curriculum delivery, evaluation, and iteration—just enough structure to run a cohort, collect evidence, and refine the program without dragging in a heavy platform.</p>
<p>It’s useful because pilots need speed and clarity: you want to validate learning outcomes and operational flow before scaling. This repo keeps the surface area minimal so changes are easy to reason about, and it helps keep the pilot aligned with real-world delivery constraints rather than theoretical plans. If you’re exploring how to operationalize AI leadership training, it’s a clean starting point and a concrete reference. <a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/ai-leaders-micro-credential-pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p>One technical takeaway: pilot programs benefit from a “thin core” architecture—capture the essentials (content, assessments, feedback loops) and make everything else optional. That discipline keeps iteration fast and avoids premature complexity, which is exactly what you want during a learning-first phase.</p>

<p>This kind of demo is useful when you want a known-good baseline for UI automation or to prove out a workflow before embedding it into a larger system.

<p>One technical takeaway: keeping the demo narrow and deterministic makes it far easier to debug failures. By minimizing optional steps and external dependencies, you can confirm whether issues are in the automation logic or in the target site’s behavior.</p>

<p>This is useful when you operate services that face mixed bot traffic and want to prevent one crawler from starving another, or from overwhelming shared queues and caches.

<p>I’m tired of vague “X is smarter” model talk. In production, I need to know what breaks, what costs time, and how to guardrail it. The new Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.3 releases are promising, but the value only shows up if you choose the right model for the right slice of work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-solution">The Solution<a href="#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Solution" title="Direct link to The Solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I boiled the releases down into a decision flow: treat Codex 5.3 as the “do the task” engine (tool use, code understanding, execution), and treat Opus 4.6 as the “reasoning and synthesis” engine (big-picture thinking, trade-off analysis, long-form explanation). That’s the core split. But the edge cases matter.</p>

<p>Caveats I’m not ignoring:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">If you want runnable edits and tool usage, Opus can be a detour. I wouldn’t put it in the loop unless you need the narrative or product framing first.</li>

<ul>
<li class="">Codex 5.3 is the right default when tool use or code changes are on the critical path.</li>
<li class="">Opus 4.6 shines when the deliverable is a narrative, a plan, or a trade-off decision.</li>
<li class="">The fastest way to ship is picking the model that matches the job, not the one with the most hype.</li>
<li class="">Model choice doesn’t replace checks; it only shifts where you place them.</li>

Centrarro argues you can deliver a B2B portal experience on top of a standard Drupal Commerce store without spinning up a separate platform or domain.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a concrete, extendable starting point for the portal experience described in the post: a gated landing page, clear account highlights, and a place to route buyers to the next action.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I built a small Drupal module that creates a B2B portal route, lets admins tune portal labels, and surfaces a summary table. The summary builder is isolated so it can be swapped for real Commerce order data, customer profiles, or pricing logic.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-commerce-b2b-portal-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Centarro’s guidance centers on keeping B2B and B2C on the same Drupal Commerce install while differentiating catalog access, price lists, and payment terms.</li>
<li class="">A portal doesn’t need a bespoke front end to start; a clear authenticated landing page plus targeted account data gets you most of the way there.</li>
<li class="">The companion Commerce Kickstart webinar on February 26, 2026 is positioned as a hands-on walkthrough for implementing these portal patterns.</li>

Drupal CMS recipes are the most practical building block for AI-driven site assembly: they translate a plan into installable modules and configuration with one apply step.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a compact, repeatable recipe starter that mirrors how Drupal CMS expects recipes to be packaged and applied, plus a tiny helper that lets AI tools emit a recipe YAML from structured inputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
I built a small recipe package and a PHP blueprint helper. The recipe installs a baseline site-building stack and creates an <code>AI Builder</code> role, while the helper turns a JSON brief into a valid <code>recipe.yml</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/drupal-cms-ai-recipe-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Recipes are Composer packages of type <code>drupal-recipe</code> meant to be unpacked and applied, not kept as runtime dependencies.</li>
<li class="">Applying a recipe happens from the webroot via <code>drush recipe</code> (Drush 13+) or <code>php core/scripts/drupal recipe</code>, and the core recipe-unpack workflow can place recipes in a <code>/recipes</code> directory.</li>
<li class="">Recipe configuration actions live in <code>recipe.yml</code> and are expressed as config entity IDs plus actions like <code>createIfNotExists</code>, <code>grantPermissions</code>, and <code>simpleConfigUpdate</code>.</li>
<li class="">The Recipes initiative APIs are available in core as experimental in Drupal 10.3+ and Drupal 11.</li>

Enterprise agentic systems scale when they feel less like a demo and more like a governed service. That means routing, guardrails, and budgets are first-class citizens from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Built It</strong>
I wanted a lightweight way to translate Netomi-style enterprise lessons into code you can run and test. The result is a playbook that makes confidence thresholds, escalation rules, and spend limits explicit.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>
The playbook centers on three mechanics: policy guardrails that block or escalate sensitive intents, confidence gating that pushes uncertainty to humans, and a budget guard that keeps costs predictable. Each decision is surfaced as structured output so it can be audited later.</p>
<p><strong>The Code</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/victorstack-ai/netomi-agentic-lessons-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">View Code</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Guardrails and human escalation become clearer when they are codified as small, testable rules.</li>
<li class="">Budget limits are easier to enforce when they are part of routing, not an afterthought.</li>
<li class="">A tiny playbook is enough to capture the operational posture of enterprise agentic systems.</li>
