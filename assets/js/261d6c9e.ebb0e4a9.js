I wanted a single, repeatable narrative that turns raw inputs into a clean, publishable devlog without losing technical depth.\\n\\n**The Solution**\\nI framed the day as a pipeline: inputs come in, I synthesize, then I publish. That sounds simple, but the real win is the structure\u2014every build and learning has a place, and the story stays coherent.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n  A[Collect Builds & Learnings] --\x3e B{Synthesize Narrative};\\n  B --Yes--\x3e C[Publish Devlog];\\n  B --No--\x3e D[Refine Notes];\\n```\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"py\\" label=\\"Python\\">\\n    ```python\\n    def synthesize(builds, learnings):\\n        story = f\\"Built {len(builds)} things, learned {len(learnings)} things.\\"\\n        return story\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"js\\" label=\\"JS\\">\\n    ```js\\n    const synthesize = (builds, learnings) =>\\n      `Built ${builds.length} things, learned ${learnings.length} things.`;\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>\\n  Synthesizing narratives...\\n  Validating structure...\\n  Emitting MDX...\\n</details>\\n\\n:::note\\nI treat devlogs as build artifacts, not diary entries. That mindset keeps them technical and useful later.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip\\nWhen I write the hook last, it becomes sharper and more honest about what actually shipped.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nIf I skip the structure, I always forget key learnings. The template is non-negotiable now.\\n:::\\n\\n:::danger\\nPublishing without context is worse than not publishing at all. The story is the value.\\n:::\\n\\n**The Code**\\n[View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/agent-hq)\\n\\n**What I Learned**\\n- PHP 8.4 is shaping up to tighten the language with features that reduce boilerplate and sharpen type safety. I\u2019m already thinking about how that simplifies plugin code paths.\\n- WordPress 6.7\u2019s release cadence keeps pushing me toward more defensive upgrade paths and test coverage, especially around editor-related behavior.\\n- Drupal 11 prep work is a reminder: staying ready is cheaper than scrambling later. I\u2019m aligning my build habits to make upgrades boring."}]}}')}}]);
