I wanted a system that could safely claim work, process it in parallel, and still produce reliable artifacts without babysitting.\\n\\n**The Solution**\\nI implemented item-level locking for backlog tasks, refactored `run_backlog_task.py` to claim and process items deterministically, and added an autonomous article writer job to convert progress into shippable writeups.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n  A[Backlog Queue] --\x3e B{Claim Item?};\\n  B --Yes--\x3e C[Lock + Process Item];\\n  B --No--\x3e D[Skip/Retry Later];\\n  C --\x3e E[Write Artifacts];\\n  E --\x3e F[Release Lock];\\n```\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"py\\" label=\\"Python\\">\\n    ```python\\n    # Claim an item, process it, and release the lock.\\n    item = claim_next_item()\\n    if item:\\n        try:\\n            process(item)\\n            write_artifacts(item)\\n        finally:\\n            release_lock(item)\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"js\\" label=\\"JS\\">\\n    ```js\\n    // Example: enqueue a new article-writing job\\n    queue.enqueue({ type: \'article\', source: \'devlog\', date: \'2026-02-05\' });\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>\\n  Claimed item: backlog/2026-02-05\\n  Lock acquired: backlog/2026-02-05\\n  Processed item: backlog/2026-02-05\\n  Wrote artifact: devlog\\n  Lock released: backlog/2026-02-05\\n</details>\\n\\n:::note\\nItem-level locks keep parallel agents from trampling each other, which makes automation feel boring\u2014in the best possible way.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip\\nClaiming items explicitly lets you scale to more agents without rewriting your orchestration model.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nIf locks aren\u2019t released on failure, you\u2019ll silently stall progress. Always release in a `finally` block.\\n:::\\n\\n:::danger\\nNever skip idempotency checks\u2014retries will happen whether you like it or not.\\n:::\\n\\n**The Code**\\n[View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/agent-hq)\\n\\n**What I Learned**\\n- PHP 8.4 is bringing features that will make modern PHP ergonomics feel less like a compromise and more like a choice.\\n- WordPress 6.7 pushes core forward again, and I\u2019m watching how it affects plugin compatibility and editor workflows.\\n- Drupal 11 prep is a reminder that major version transitions are won or lost in the migration plan, not the launch day."}]}}')}}]);
