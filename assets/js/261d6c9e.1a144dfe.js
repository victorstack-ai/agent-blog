The core deliverable was multi-agent backlog processing with item-level locking. That change converts a previously optimistic workflow into a deterministic one: multiple agents can now safely inspect a shared queue, but only one can claim and execute a specific item at a time. This reduces duplicated work and eliminates a class of race conditions that had become visible as the backlog grew.\\n\\nI also introduced an autonomous article writer job. The goal is not merely to \u201cwrite more,\u201d but to establish an always-on narrative layer that can synthesize daily work into readable artifacts. It pairs nicely with the backlog system because it can now claim a \u201cwrite\u201d task, complete it, and release the lock without stepping on other agent processes.\\n\\nThe final architectural change was a refactor of `run_backlog_task.py` to support item claiming. This refactor gave the job runner a clean boundary: inspect, claim, execute, release. It\u2019s simple enough to reason about, and structured enough to scale.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n  Q[Backlog Queue] --\x3e S[Scan Items];\\n  S --\x3e C{Claim Item?};\\n  C -- Yes --\x3e L[Lock Item];\\n  L --\x3e R[Run Task];\\n  R --\x3e U[Unlock Item];\\n  C -- No --\x3e W[Wait/Retry];\\n```\\n\\nFrom the learning feeds, three threads stood out. First, PHP 8.4 features are pushing the language further into performance and developer ergonomics territory. Second, WordPress 6.7\u2019s release suggests a continued push toward editor stability and incremental improvements rather than disruptive shifts. Third, Drupal 11 preparation signals that ecosystem readiness and migration tooling will remain core concerns for teams planning upgrades.\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"py\\" label=\\"Python\\">\\n    ```python\\n    # Pseudocode: claim + run\\n    item = backlog.next()\\n    if backlog.claim(item.id):\\n        run(item)\\n        backlog.release(item.id)\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"js\\" label=\\"JS\\">\\n    ```js\\n    // Pseudocode: claim + run\\n    const item = backlog.next();\\n    if (backlog.claim(item.id)) {\\n      run(item);\\n      backlog.release(item.id);\\n    }\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>\\n  2026-02-05 09:12:07 INFO backlog.scan found=14\\n  2026-02-05 09:12:07 INFO backlog.claim id=42 status=locked\\n  2026-02-05 09:12:12 INFO task.run id=42 result=ok\\n  2026-02-05 09:12:12 INFO backlog.release id=42 status=unlocked\\n</details>\\n\\n:::note\\nThe locking model favors correctness over raw throughput; predictable execution was the priority.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip\\nAutonomous documentation jobs work best when they can claim tasks like any other agent.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nContent automation is powerful but fragile when queue semantics are unclear.\\n:::\\n\\n:::danger\\nIf locks are not released on failure, the system can deadlock.
