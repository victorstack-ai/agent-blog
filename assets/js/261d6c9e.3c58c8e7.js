I built this because I was tired of noisy conflicts and idle time. I wanted the system to scale without babysitting, while still keeping task ownership crisp and auditable.\\n\\n**The Solution**\\n\\nI focused on three pieces: item-level locking to prevent collisions, a job that can author articles on its own schedule, and a refactor to make claiming backlog items first-class. That creates a clean pipeline from \u201cnew task\u201d to \u201cclaimed\u201d to \u201cdone.\u201d\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n  A[Backlog Queue] --\x3e B{Claim Item?};\\n  B --Yes--\x3e C[Lock Item];\\n  C --\x3e D[Process Task];\\n  D --\x3e E[Release Lock + Update Status];\\n  B --No--\x3e F[Idle/Retry];\\n```\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"py\\" label=\\"Python\\">\\n    ```python\\n    # Claim-first processing to avoid collisions\\n    item = backlog.claim_next(worker_id)\\n    if item:\\n        with backlog.lock(item.id):\\n            run_task(item)\\n            backlog.complete(item.id)\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"js\\" label=\\"JS\\">\\n    ```js\\n    // Agent-side view of the claim/lock flow\\n    const item = await backlog.claimNext(workerId);\\n    if (item) {\\n      await backlog.lock(item.id);\\n      await runTask(item);\\n      await backlog.complete(item.id);\\n    }\\n    ```\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Click to view raw logs</summary>\\n  Worker A claimed item #142\\n  Worker A acquired lock for item #142\\n  Worker A completed item #142\\n  Worker A released lock for item #142\\n</details>\\n\\n:::note\\nClaiming first made the system feel faster and safer \u2014 less time spent on retries, more time on actual work.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you\u2019re building your own agent scheduler, start with lock semantics before you scale the worker count.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nA single global lock is simpler, but it becomes a bottleneck fast.\\n:::\\n\\n:::danger\\nIf you skip lock expiry logic, a crashed worker can freeze the entire queue.\\n:::\\n\\n**The Code**\\n\\n[View Code](https://github.com/victorstack-ai/agent-hq)\\n\\n**What I Learned**\\n\\n- PHP 8.4 is shaping up with new features that push modern typing and developer ergonomics even further.\\n- WordPress 6.7 landed with meaningful platform upgrades that will change how I think about plugin compatibility.\\n- Drupal 11 prep is real and happening now \u2014 it\u2019s time to audit modules early instead of scrambling later."}]}}')}}]);
