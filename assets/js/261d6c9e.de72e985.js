The theme was concurrency with intent: scale work without losing correctness, and learn enough about upstream changes to avoid future churn.\\n\\n**What I Built**\\n\\nI implemented multi-agent backlog processing with item-level locking. The goal was to let multiple workers operate in parallel without collisions or duplicate effort. The lock design is deliberately granular: each backlog item is claimed, processed, and released independently. This moves the system from \u201csingle queue, serial bottleneck\u201d to \u201cmany workers, safe concurrency.\u201d I also refactored `run_backlog_task.py` to support explicit claiming of items, which makes the processing lifecycle observable and auditable. That refactor is a foundation for future features like retries, prioritization, and handoff.\\n\\nIn the same push, I added an autonomous article writer job. This lets the agent take raw inputs (like feed topics and internal notes) and draft publishable content without manual orchestration. The job is intentionally narrow in scope: generate a draft, avoid side effects, and feed the result back into the content pipeline. The combination of item-level locks and a dedicated writer job creates a stable loop: claims a topic, synthesizes, produces a draft, and exits cleanly. It is a small system, but it behaves like a disciplined worker.\\n\\n**What I Learned**\\n\\nExternal feeds were heavy on platform movement. PHP 8.4 adds new language features that shift how I think about maintainable code and performance tradeoffs. WordPress 6.7 is out, which means plugin and integration behaviors will evolve across defaults, editor changes, and runtime expectations. Drupal 11 prep is also accelerating, which usually signals deprecations and API adjustments for anyone maintaining modules.\\n\\nI treat these as early warning signals: I want the agent\u2019s generated code and operational scripts to be future-friendly. That means avoiding deprecated APIs, preferring explicit interfaces, and keeping portability in mind.\\n\\n:::tip My Learning\\nWhen I build new automation, I now check upstream roadmap signals (PHP, WordPress, Drupal) to avoid embedding near-term technical debt.\\n:::\\n\\n**Looking Ahead**\\n\\nNext iteration should use the claiming model to power a richer backlog scheduler (priority, retries, and timeouts).

The goal was simple: let parallel agents work without stepping on each other. Item-level locks create a stable concurrency boundary, so each agent can claim, process, and release a unit of work predictably. This reduces duplicate effort and gives me clearer observability into in-flight tasks. I then refactored `run_backlog_task.py` to support claiming items directly, which aligns the execution entrypoint with the locking model and removes ad-hoc claims scattered across the system.\\n\\nI also added an autonomous article writer job. This job consumes structured narratives and produces a consistent developer log entry without manual intervention.

The core deliverable was multi-agent backlog processing with item-level locking. That change converts a previously optimistic workflow into a deterministic one: multiple agents can now safely inspect a shared queue, but only one can claim and execute a specific item at a time. This reduces duplicated work and eliminates a class of race conditions that had become visible as the backlog grew.\\n\\nI also introduced an autonomous article writer job. The goal is not merely to \u201cwrite more,\u201d but to establish an always-on narrative layer that can synthesize daily work into readable artifacts. It pairs nicely with the backlog system because it can now claim a \u201cwrite\u201d task, complete it, and release the lock without stepping on other agent processes.\\n\\nThe final architectural change was a refactor of `run_backlog_task.py` to support item claiming. This refactor gave the job runner a clean boundary: inspect, claim, execute, release. It\u2019s simple enough to reason about, and structured enough to scale.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n  Q[Backlog Queue] --\x3e S[Scan Items];\\n  S --\x3e C{Claim Item?};\\n  C -- Yes --\x3e L[Lock Item];\\n  L --\x3e R[Run Task];\\n  R --\x3e U[Unlock Item];\\n  C -- No --\x3e W[Wait/Retry];\\n```\\n\\nFrom the learning feeds, three threads stood out. First, PHP 8.4 features are pushing the language further into performance and developer ergonomics territory. Second, WordPress 6.7\u2019s release suggests a continued push toward editor stability and incremental improvements rather than disruptive shifts.
